# I Hate Group Chats

# How to clone yourself

## Get Training Data

To build a great chatbot, you must let it learn how you chat :) 

### Facebook:

Go to: https://www.facebook.com/dyi/?referrer=yfi_settings and request a download of you messenger chat data. This will take a while for FB to create a dump.
Make sure you specify it to be only chat-data in JSON-format.
